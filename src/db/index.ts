/**
 * A pooled TCP connection to Postgres (node-postgres), replacing the previous
 * neon-http driver. On a long-running server this is the right model:
 *  - persistent connections — no per-query HTTPS handshake (neon-http did one
 *    round-trip *per query*, ~90ms each)
 *  - real transactions — `db.transaction(...)` actually works, so multi-step
 *    writes (enrol + audit-log, create + return) are atomic
 *  - resilient to Neon compute suspend/resume
 *
 * DATABASE_URL points at Neon's PgBouncer pooler ("-pooler" host) — which is
 * exactly what this wants. `max` stays modest: the pooler multiplexes many
 * client connections onto few Postgres ones, and the app runs multiple
 * instances. TLS is taken from `sslmode=require` in the connection string.
